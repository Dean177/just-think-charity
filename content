JUST THINK...
Giving to those who need it most.
We are a mobile clothing collection charity picking up your unwanted clothes and blankets to give to those out on the streets all year round.
We started in 2015 with just two of us on Christmas Eve with our "blessing in a bag" idea making up small bags with all the essentials to get the people living on the streets through the toughest of times.
The end of 2016 we did exactly the same thing but with more people involved which gave us the blessing of helping more of the homeless and those in need in the shelters over Christmas time.
From that night with the extra interest from our friends and family we promised to take our ideas and visions to the next step and create the Just Think charity.
THERE IS NO MONEY INVOLVED, this is a FREE non profitable charity. Simply use any of the contact information we've provided and we will set up a time a date to come and pick your donations! If we are unable to answer the phone please leave a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible!
Please don't forget to this share this page as much as possible to spread the word.
