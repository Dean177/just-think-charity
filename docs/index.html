        <p>We are a mobile clothing collection charity, picking up your unwanted clothes and blankets to give to those out
          on the streets, all year round.
        We started in 2015 with just two of us on Christmas Eve with our "blessing in a bag" idea; making up small bags
        with all the essentials to get the people living on the streets through the toughest of times.
        At the end of 2016 we did exactly the same thing but with more people involved, which gave us the blessing of helping
          more of the homeless and those in need at the shelters over Christmas time.
        From that night, with the extra interest from our friends and family, we promised to take our ideas and visions
          to the next step and create the Just Think charity.
          THERE IS NO MONEY INVOLVED, this is a FREE non profitable charity. Simply use any of the contact information
            we've provided and we will set up a time and date to come and pick up your donations! If we are unable to answer
            the phone please leave a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
        Please remember to share this page as much as possible to help spread the word.</p>
